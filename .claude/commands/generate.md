description: Generate Rails resources (model, controller, scaffold, etc.)
---

I'll help you generate Rails resources. What would you like to generate?

Common options:
- `scaffold` - Full CRUD resource (model, controller, views, migration)
- `model` - Just the model and migration
- `controller` - Just the controller
- `migration` - Just a migration
- `resource` - Model, controller, and routes (no views)

Please specify what you want to generate and I'll run the appropriate Rails generator.
